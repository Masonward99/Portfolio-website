          <p>
            Before Northcoders I was a student, but during my studies I had
            realized that what I wasnâ€™t passionate about what I was studying.
            So, I decided to look for other options for career paths and
            development was suggested to me by a friend. I started learning the
            pre course material for Northcoders and immediately realized this
            was what I wanted to do, I became addicted to solving the problems
            provided, constantly refactoring my solutions as I was learning. I
            enjoyed it so much I decided to start my bootcamp before I had
            finished university.
