        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          From the moment I created my first program in JavaScript I was hooked.
          For the next few days, I was completely addicted to learning about
          JavaScript, it was all that I could think about. I enjoyed it so much
          that I decided to do a fulltime bootcamp at the same time as I was
          completing my studies at university. Iâ€™m currently studying Computing
          and IT at the Open University part time.
